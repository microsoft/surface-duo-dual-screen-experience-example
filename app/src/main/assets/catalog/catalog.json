      "primaryDescription": "Some solid-bodied guitars, such as the Gibson Les Paul Supreme, the PRS Singlecut, and the Fender Telecaster Thinline, are built with hollow chambers in the body.

There are four basic types of bridge and tailpiece systems on electric guitars. Within these four types are many variants. A hard-tail guitar bridge anchors the strings at or directly behind the bridge and is fastened securely to the top of the instrument.",

      "primaryDescription": "Frets are positioned proportionally to scale lengthâ€”the shorter the scale length, the closer the fret spacing. Opinions vary regarding the effect of scale length on tone and feel.   Popular opinion holds that longer scale length contributes to greater amplitude..",
      "secondaryDescription": "Reports of playing feel are greatly complicated by the many factors involved in this perception. String gauge and design, neck construction and relief, guitar setup, playing style, and other factors contribute to the subjective impression of playability or feel. Aside from possible engineering advantages, some feel that with the rising cost of rare tonewoods, man-made materials may be economically preferable and more ecologically sensitive.",

      "primaryDescription": "Electric guitars are used in many styles of music including rock, blues, country, jazz, funk, and more. Electric guitars feature pickups and electronics that turn the vibration of the strings into an electrical signal that is then sent to a guitar amplifier. Some popular electric guitars include the Fender Stratocaster and Telecaster, and the Gibson Les Paul and SG. Electric guitars come in many forms like solidbody, semi-hollowbody, or hollowbody guitars. Each guitar body offers sonic differences that should be considered before you buy.",
