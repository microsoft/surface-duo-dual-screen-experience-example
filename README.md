# Dual Screen Experience Example

The application provides developers and designers with real world, working examples of how to make 
use of the dual-screen/foldable form factor in different ways. It enables an end-to-end experience 
using a prescribed user scenario, centered around the needs of a travelling salesperson who visits 
various fictitious stores which are interested in buying the salespersons’ fictitious products. 
It helps the salesperson select and navigate to multiple predetermined customer locations in a city, 
assist the salespersons tasks in various ways during the visit to each potential client and create 
a report of each visit.

When spanned across the folding feature, a Developer Mode option appears in the toolbar which shows 
more details regarding each screen - the code behind it, the [user interface patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/introduction#dual-screen-app-patterns) 
it implements and the [dual-screen controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/android/api-reference/dualscreen-library/) it uses.
